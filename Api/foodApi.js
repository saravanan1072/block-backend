In India there are many people living in slums, they do not have proper shelter. Moreover, they are not able to have even a one-time meal. They starve for days and are always in a state of sickness. Many children are there on roads who are laboring to get a daily meal. After seeing conditions like these people should not dare to waste food.

These are famous apart from Indian cuisine. You cannot waste food by taking only a sufficient amount of it. Moreover, people should seal pack the leftover food and give it to the beggars.

Some people enjoy eating in a restaurant, and some people enjoy making their own meals at home. There are many kinds of food that we can buy, so we can taste the different styles we want, and try foods from different countries. In America, it is very easy for us to find special food to eat because people from many different countries have opened their style restaurant. If we have enough money to spend we can eat many, many, kinds of meals. We can invite our friends to try them. It is very convenient, so many people want to come here.--Florence In my native country, women usually eat at home and cook at home. Only men go to a teahouse or restaurant. I think Chinese women still follow the old Chinese tradition and they are too scared to look at all the different faces. But over here, men and women are all the same, eat at the same table, talk, and play in the same places together. Nobody cares who looks at you.--Julie When I was in my country, I always ate rice, vegetables, and meat, but now I am in America. I had a big change. I can eat any kind of food in San Francisco. I like to eat pizza and Vietnamese food, but I hate hamburgers.--Tiffany When I came here, I had a big problem with my son, because we ate differently in our country and I didn't know where to buy everything that we like to eat. For example, the tortillas are different in El Salvador. Here I have to make them because although there are many things from Mexico, they are similar but not the same."},

Some popular foods in my country are: tamales, pupusas, pasteles (corn and beef filling), empanadas (platano with milk). I miss Salvadorean cheese, cream, etc. A good breakfast in my country is: platanos, eggs, beans, cheese and French bread. When I cook like this my husband and my son become happy.--Wendick I like to eat any kind of food. When I lived in my country, I lived by myself for my job around 15 years. Three times a day, every day, I went to a restaurant. sometimes I went to a Chinese restaurant, but I almost always went to a Korean restaurant. I've eaten every kind of food except dog meat and snake. But all the time I wanted to eat home-made food. Restaurant food is just delicious, but not good healthy food--you get hungry fast. For example, a long time ago my wife got pregnant. If we went to a restaurant and then to a check-up for a blood test and cholesterol test, the test results were not so good. They use a lot of seasoning. Now, sometimes we eat out for the kids, but I don't like it. No money, no time, not healthy. But my wife complains too much. She says working too much for food.-Saing Well...Some eating habits have changed since I first arrived here. I was used to eating very spicy food and eating three times a day. Sometimes I went to the restaurants in my country, and a few times I cooked. Now my life is different because I almost never cook. I eat two times a day (sometimes once a day) because I'm always busy. I go to the restaurant three times a week."},

It it always convenient, enjoyable, and often too much for me. I like to go to the supermarket here. There are a lot of different vegetables from those in our country. The first difference is its size. How big are they? I think it's caused by the soil. The next one is color. How colorful are they? Yesterday I bought sweet potatoes to cook. I planned to boil those with apples, but I was so surprised to look at the cut surface. It was colored orange! I've never seen those sweet potatoes in my country. While I was cooking, I was doubtful about the results. Finally, I added raisins. That was a very nice dish!--Keiko  In Mexico, usually the food is fresh. The Mexican dishes are spicy and many times they have a lot of condiments. These condiments are sometimes stronger and heavier for tourists. One difference between American and Mexican customs is we eat three times a day: 1. Breakfast is between 7:00 and 9:00 am. We take a big meal, for example, 2 eggs with bacon, beans, tortillas or bread and juice or milk. 2. Our lunch often is at 2:00 pm. This is the biggest meal. This time we have soup, salad, beef or chicken or seafood. 3. At night we take something light for dinner around 9:00 pm. The people always need tortillas with their dishes.--Desirée Everything must be fresh. In this city, the way people shop for food is different from other cities.

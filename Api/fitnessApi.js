Health cannot be ignored because our body needs to be healthy to function correctly. Eating fruits and vegetables boosts one’s health. While eating junk food hurts our health. Regular exercises can help us to build a healthy and fit body that would be resistant to diseases.Health has been defined by WHO as the state of total wellbeing, of both the body and the mind. It is essential to understand that a perfect state of health is defined by many parameters. Some of which are physical, while others prefer a person’s emotional state.The metabolism of the body is largely responsible for our health and fitness. A better metabolism would mean faster absorption of nutrients into our bodies. While a slower metabolism would mean a slower absorption of food. A higher metabolism rate can be achieved by keeping the body healthy. This is possible when we start taking care of our nutrition. Healthy nutrition is not only rich in vegetables and fruits, but it is balanced and has a moderate amount of everything in a balanced proportion. The key to a healthy body starts with the art of balancing our intake and being aware of what harms us and what is good for us."},

A healthy person’s body is in complete harmony with his mind. We can practice the art of health and wellness by keeping in mind that our bodies are made from living tissues. Those tissues require nutrition to grow, and the food we eat is directly responsible for the nutrients that reach our tissues. Keeping that in mind, we must understand the importance of a balanced meal.A meal is balanced when it has all the components like carbohydrates, starch, fat, protein, and vitamins in an equal proportion. If the balance is disturbed, we can eat a lot of the same type of food. Even if something is good for our health, eating too much can have a negative impact. For example, even if vitamins are beneficial to our health, eating a lot of vitamins can convert the excess quantity into toxic substances. The perfect sign of a healthy human body is resistant to diseases.  A healthy person can effectively fight off disease-causing germs. Immunity is provided by the WBC cells in our blood. These cells determine how strong a person’s immunity is. Immunity can be improved by eating foods rich in antioxidants like melons, citrus, guava, and strawberries."},

It does not mean to have only proteins and carbs. Your food should contain more amounts of these materials.Being healthy and fit are two different terms but are interlinked to each other. Health is a state of body where your body, as well as the brain, are in a good state. Staying fit is something that reflects your body's stamina and strength.

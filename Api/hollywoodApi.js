A typical encounter with studio executives would begin with something like, Wow! We love you! You did this and you did that and we think you're great! Followed, almost immediately, by, And now that we do that stuff anymore because that not what we want from you. Just do it our way.

To achieve the best results in this section, you must understand how to approach and answer the different Question types in the Reading Module. By solving and reviewing Sample Reading Questions from past IELTS papers, you can ensure that your Reading skills are up to the mark.This chapter examines the ‘Golden Age’ of the Hollywood film studio system and explores how a particular kind of filmmaking developed during this period in US film history. It also focuses on the two key elements which influenced the emergence of the classic Hollywood studio system: the advent of sound and the business ideal of vertical integration. In addition to its historical interest, inspecting the growth of the studio system may offer clues regarding the kinds of struggles that accompany the growth of any new medium.” These lines throw light on the benefits and takeaways as far as learning about the golden age of Hollywood is concerned, the paradigm shift in the industry, and the transitions that the industry went through in a course of time."},

At MGM, Warner Bros, and Columbia, the same men ran their studios for decades. The rise of the studio system also hinged on the treatment of stars, who were constructed and exploited to suit a studio’s image and schedule.” These lines illustrate the powers and control of the prominent studios of that era. The studios not only enjoyed the fame and money of the movies they made, but also the control they had over each of the processes related to their movies and the actors thereof.The shift of the industry away from ‘silent’ films began during the late 1920s.

The major studios realized they could increase their profits by handling each stage of a film’s life: production (making the film), distribution (getting the film out to people), and exhibition (owning the theaters in major cities where films were shown first). Five studios, ‘The Big Five’, worked to achieve vertical integration through the late 1940s, owning vast real estate on which to construct elaborate sets.” These lines imply how the studios transitioned into being mighty totalitarian and overweening factors by various means, such as vertical integration.

They also had to create product differentiation. Examining how each production company tried to differentiate itself has led to loose characterizations of individual studios’ styles. MGM tended to put out a lot of all-star productions while Paramount excelled in comedy and Warner Bros, developed a reputation for gritty social realism. 20th Century Fox forged the musical and a lot of prestige biographies, while Universal specialized in classic horror movies.” These lines make it apparent that the studios of prominence specialized and differentiated themselves into various genres. Some differentiated themselves from the rest of the market by clinging to the genre of comedy while others chose horror or biographies as their genres.In 1948, struggling independent movie producers and exhibitors finally triumphed in their battle against the big studios’ monopolistic behavior. In the United States versus Paramount federal decree of that year, the studios were ordered to give up their theaters in what is commonly referred to as ‘divestiture’ – opening the market to smaller producers. This, coupled with the advent of television in the 1950s, seriously compromised the studio system’s influence and profits.” This suggests that the authority of the movie moguls came to an end in the year 1948 when the process called divestiture coerced them to give up a fair share of the opportunity to the aspiring and budding production houses"},

Studios now had proof that ‘talkie’ films would make their money, but the financial investment in this kind of filmmaking would require, from new camera equipment to new projection facilities, made the studios hesitant to invest at first.” This suggests that the moviemakers were not immediately ready to adapt to the changes as far as the inclusion of synchronized speech is concerned. This process of adaptation was rather indecisive at first and the concerned people were rather iffy in this regard.Although full integration of sound into movies was completed by 1930, it would take somewhat longer for them to regain their stylistic elegance and dexterity. The camera now had to be encased in a big, clumsy, immovable soundproof box. In addition, actors struggled, having to direct their speech to awkwardly-hidden microphones in huge plants, telephones, or even costumes.” These lines highlight the cons/drawbacks of the dubbing process of the movie actors.

Stars could be loaned out to other production companies at any time. Studio bosses could also force bad roles on actors, and manipulate every single detail of stars’ images with their mammoth in-house publicity departments.” These lines make it quite clear that the studios had all the authority from distributing movies to loaning the stars to assigning them the roles- good/bad- irrespective of the actors’ demands. Hence, the statement is true. “The major studios realized they could increase their profits by handling each stage of a film’s life: production (making the film), distribution (getting the film out to people), and exhibition (owning the theaters in major cities where films were shown first). Five studios, ‘The Big Five’, worked to achieve vertical integration through the late 1940s, owning vast real estate on which to construct elaborate sets. In addition, these studios set the exact terms of films’ release dates and patterns.” These lines suggest that through the process of vertical integration, the studios who had repressive and autocratic control took every process of a movie released under the name of their studios under their authority."},

In response, producers will tap their spare capacity, leaving it lower than it was before. Eventually, this will lead to a serious imbalance between supply and demand.“Right now, we’re still balanced to a surplus because China has still yet to fully rebound,” Currie told Bloomberg. “Are we going to run out of spare production capacity? Potentially by 2024 you start to have a serious problem.”Saudi Arabia’s energy minister has echoed the concern about insufficient spending on future oil production. In fact, Abdulaziz bin Salman has been warning about that for more than a year, and he did so again this weekend.“All of those so-called sanctions, embargoes, lack of investments, they will convolute into one thing and one thing only, a lack of energy supplies of all kinds when they are most needed,” he said.Brent crude has been trading at between $75 and $80 a barrel for most of the year so far but Goldman, along with other investment banks, believes it has higher to go. According to Currie, the oil market will swing into a deficit by May."},

One of the main drivers behind the resurgence in price growth is China's decision to relax its strict zero-COVID-19 policy and reopen its economy – the second-largest in the world. Doing so has helped to ease supply chain pressures and revived Beijing's status as a manufacturing powerhouse.

In 2019, Beijing was actually the leading global spender in international travel with 155 million tourists spending more than a quarter of a trillion dollars overseas.

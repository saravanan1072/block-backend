Newmont said it would offer 0.380 of its own shares for each Newcrest share held.The offer follows an earlier approach by the U.S. company that valued each Newcrest share at 0.363 Newmont shares. Newcrest’s directors rejected that proposal as too low. On Monday, Newcrest said it would consider the terms of the latest offer.The approach by Newmont illustrates how producers are seeking to do deals to shore up their gold reserves, cut costs and improve returns for shareholders. In 2019, Newmont acquired Canadian gold producer Goldcorp Inc. in a transaction valued at $10 billion. The same year, Newmont and rival Barrick Gold Corp. formed a joint venture in Nevada to cut costs, after an earlier offer from Barrick to buy Newmont was rejected.Newmont said the businesses are complementary and that a combined entity—which would be owned 30% by Newcrest shareholders and 70% by Newmont—could “set the standard for sustainable and responsible gold mining.Newcrest has mines in Australia, Canada and Papua New Guinea.We believe a combination of Newmont and Newcrest presents a powerful value proposition to our respective shareholders, workforce and the communities in which we operate, Newmont Chief Executive Tom Palmer said in a statement.One major shareholder in Newcrest would  be surprised to see a deal proceed as currently proposed, he told The Wall StSimon Mawhinney, chief investment officer of Allan Gray Australia, said an all-stock offer makes sense, but the ratio as it stands does look fair given Newcrestlow-cost and long-life assets.
